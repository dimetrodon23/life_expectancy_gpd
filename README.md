# Life Expectancy and GDP ReadMe

This is the first of three projects completed during my Codecademy course on data science for analytics. In this project, I look at data on life expectancy over time for several countries and draw conclusions based on my findings. This particular project I completed after the data visualization module, and uses Python libraries for data visualization.
